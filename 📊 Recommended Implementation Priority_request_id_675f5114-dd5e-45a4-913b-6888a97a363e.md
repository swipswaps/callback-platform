📊 Recommended Implementation Priority:
Admin Dashboard - Most impactful for operations
Prometheus Metrics - Essential for monitoring
Job Retry with Backoff - Improves reliability
API Token Auth - Secures admin endpoints
Recurring Tasks - Already partially implemented
Worker Health Monitoring - Production readiness
Queue Prioritization - Scale optimization
Escalation Policies - Advanced feature
Concurrency Controls - Already have basic version
Commit Modes - Already using transactional DB
Would you like me to implement any of these features? I recommend starting with Admin Dashboard as it would give you immediate visibility into your callback system.
